Solved (Tested on Yoga 900)

This is NOT mindless tinkering (killing services, etc), the OP looks like he knew what he was doing and this just worked for me straight off the bat. I'm running a Yoga 900 with stock win 10 64 bit.

I had this problem with my Synaptics touchpad on a Lenovo laptop running Windows 10. (Fortunately it only one of two user accounts was broken)

I used Regedit to fix the problem

Press Win and type Regedit
and Navigate
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
SOFTWARE
Synatics
SynTP
TouchpadPS2 (this has numbers as well)
3FingerGestures
OK we are in the right place For the 3 Finger Swipes to work correctly edit the following ActionIDs to the following ActionID1 = 5c ActionID3 = 5f ActionID5 = 5d ActionID7 = 5e
Exit the Registry Editor and reset (reboot or signout and signin)
The 3 Finger Swipes should now work as intended. HOWEVER. Some people prefer the 3 finger swipe to control the forward and back button in browsers set ActionID3 = 1c ActionID7 = 1c
